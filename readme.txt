Analyze your website visitors’ actions, the pages they navigate, and the topics that interest them. Our behavior tracking tool helps you set up events for different actions on your web pages and set goals for your visitors to perform. Based on whether your visitors achieve or miss these goals, you can build personalized journeys that engage them, and help them convert into customers.

* Choose whether you want to track all the pages on your site, only specific pages, or pages of specific categories.
* Using a 'date' option, you can choose to track the pages created after a selected date.

= Signup Forms =

Embed signup forms to your WordPress site and entice your web visitors to sign up for your content. Once they sign up, they’re automatically added as leads in the respective mailing lists inside your Marketing Automation account.
